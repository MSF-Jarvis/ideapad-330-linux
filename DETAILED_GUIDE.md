# Detailed steps

## Step 1 - Getting the kernel

Regardless of what distro you choose to run, try getting on the latest stable kernel to see if you actually need to build your own custom kernel. As of writing it is [4.18.14](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/log/?h=v4.18.14). If your touchpad and GPU work, you can skip to Step  2 to get WiFi going.

So you just tried the latest stable kernel and your touchpad still doesn't work. Goddamit ELAN. Thankfully this is easy to remedy. Make sure you have enough bandwidth to clone a full kernel tree (Your WiFi is dead too, so grab that ethernet cable).

```shell
git clone https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux -b master
```

This will grab the very bleeding edge of the linux development tree. If you want a working GPU, this is pretty much a necessity.

To verify if the kernel landed support for your touchpad between the latest stable release and the current `master`, run the below command.

```shell
sudo acpidump | grep -C3 ELAN
```

The output will be something like this

```shell
msfjarvis@jarvisbox:~$ sudo acpidump | grep -C3 ELAN
  5E60: 44 5B 82 48 1E 54 50 44 30 08 5F 48 49 44 0D 4D  D[.H.TPD0._HID.M
  5E70: 53 46 54 30 30 30 31 00 08 5F 43 49 44 0D 50 4E  SFT0001.._CID.PN
  5E80: 50 30 43 35 30 00 14 4F 04 5F 49 4E 49 00 A0 16  P0C50..O._INI...
  5E90: 93 54 50 54 59 01 70 0D 45 4C 41 4E 30 36 31 45  .TPTY.p.ELAN061E
  5EA0: 00 5F 48 49 44 A0 17 93 54 50 54 59 0A 02 70 0D  ._HID...TPTY..p.
  5EB0: 53 59 4E 41 32 42 34 41 00 5F 48 49 44 A0 16 93  SYNA2B4A._HID...
  5EC0: 54 50 54 59 0A 03 70 0D 41 55 49 31 36 36 38 00  TPTY..p.AUI1668.
```

See the `ELAN061E` there? That's the trackpad's ID. Grab yours, then head back into the kernel tree you just cloned to add support for the trackpad if it's missing. Open up `drivers/input/mouse/elan_i2c_core.c` and navigate to the array at line 1375.

Then, add your ID to the array before the null terminating entry in this format `{"<trackpad_id>", 0 },`. Refer to [this](https://del.dog/isadideqil.coffeescript) patch for reference. If the ID is already there, skip the step and move to the kernel compilation.

Assuming the machine hasn't been prepped for compiling kernels, go ahead and grab the dependencies.

```shell
sudo apt install build-essential libelf-dev libssl-dev -y
```

Once that's done, let's compile the actual kernel.

```shell
cp -v /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config
make oldconfig
make -j$(nproc --all)
sudo make headers_install modules_install install
```

Now reboot, and you should boot right into your newly compiled kernel with a working trackpad.


### Step 2 - Getting WiFi working

WiFi is a relatively easy affair. Just grab the `rtl8821ce` driver and install the module. Or just copypasta the commands from below because isn't that what the internet is for?

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tomaspinho/rtl8821ce
cd rtl8821ce
chmod +x dkms-install.sh; sudo ./dkms-install.sh
```

And, you guessed it, reboot.


### Step 3 - Hardware acceleration

If you built a kernel from the `master` branch as per Step 1, simply go ahead and grab the [linux-firmware](https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware) repo and run `sudo make install` to install all the needed firmware for the amdgpu module.


After following all these steps, you should have an IdeaPad 330 with a working touchpad, WiFi and hardware acceleration. Enjoy!
